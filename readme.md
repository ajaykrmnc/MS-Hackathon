    # Project Name

    ## Description

    This project aims to develop a disease prediction model using Python. The model will utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze various health parameters and predict the likelihood of a person having a specific disease.

    ## Installation

    1. Ensure that Python 3.8 is installed on your system. If not installed, you can download it from the official Python website or create a virtual environment with Python 3.8. To create a virtual environment, you can use the following command:
        ```
        python3 -m venv myenv
        ```
        Activate the virtual environment:
        - On Windows: 
            ```
            myenv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        - On macOS and Linux:
            ```
            source myenv/bin/activate
            ```
    2. Clone the repository.
    3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    4. Run the main script using `python main.py`.
    5. To run the web application, execute `streamlit run app.py`. If Streamlit is not installed, you can install it by running `pip install streamlit`.

    ## Usage

    1. Provide the necessary input data in the specified format.
    2. Run the prediction model.
    3. View the predicted disease outcome.
